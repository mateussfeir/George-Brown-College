    <h1>Assignment 2 Reflection - Mateus Sfeir 101484904</h1>
    <p>Throughout the course of this project, I had the opportunity to gain valuable insights and hands-on experience in HTML and CSS, two foundational technologies that underpin the web. Reflecting on this project, I'm pleased to acknowledge the following key takeaways and learnings:

        1. HTML Structure and Semantics: This project emphasized the importance of using proper HTML structure and semantics to create well-organized and accessible web content. I learned how to choose the most appropriate HTML elements for different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. This is crucial not only for human readability but also for search engine optimization and accessibility.

        2. CSS Styling and Layout: Working on the CSS portion of the project allowed me to dive into the world of styling and layout. I explored various CSS properties to control the visual aspects of the web page, including color, typography, margins, padding, and responsive design. I discovered the power of CSS in transforming a plain HTML document into a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

        3. Responsive Design: Understanding the principles of responsive design was a key aspect of this project. I learned how to use CSS media queries to adapt the layout and styling of a website to different screen sizes, making the content accessible and visually pleasing on a wide range of devices, from desktops to smartphones.

        4. CSS Selectors and Specificity: The project challenged me to become proficient in CSS selectors and specificity. I realized the importance of selecting the right elements and classes to target specific areas of the webpage. Learning how to manage specificity efficiently is critical for maintaining clean and maintainable code.

        5. Practical Application: One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was its practicality. I was able to apply my HTML and CSS knowledge to create a web page, incorporating text, images, links, and styling elements. This hands-on experience reinforced the theoretical concepts and allowed me to see the direct results of my coding efforts.

        6. Continuous Learning: Finally, this project highlighted the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of web development. As I worked on the project, I realized that the web development field requires continuous learning to stay updated with the latest best practices, technologies, and design trends. This encourages me to keep exploring and expanding my skills in HTML and CSS.

        In conclusion, this project was an enlightening experience that deepened my understanding of HTML and CSS. It provided me with a foundation to build upon and inspired a strong desire to continue honing my web development skills. I am excited to apply these newfound abilities to future projects and further enhance my proficiency in web development.</p>
